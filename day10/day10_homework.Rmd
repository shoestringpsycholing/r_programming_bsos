1. Find some relationship in your data (e.g., correlation, comparison of means, etc.) that is "significant" (don't worry too much about what that might mean).

2. Get an estimate of the effect size (e.g., the difference between means, or the correlation).

3. Simulate data with this effect size (either using mvrnorm or adding a simulated effect), but with a much smaller data sample.  In other words, simulate an underpowered study.

4. Examine the amount of effect-size inflation via the "significance filter" by looking at the effect sizes from the simulations, for just the sims where the effect turned out significant.
