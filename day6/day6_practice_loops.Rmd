1. Create a chunk of code that does the following:
  - get a subset of data from the `iris` data set that just includes one species
  - get the mean of each of the values, and arrange these in a one-row data frame
  - make a PDF plot of Sepal.Width by Petal.Width
  
2. Now make a copy of this code and turn it into a loop:
  - loop through all three species
  - combine the results from each loop into a single data frame
    - do this the "slow" way and the "fast" way
  - combine the plots into a single PDF
  
3. Make another copy of the loop, adding an `if` statement that will have the effect of skipping plants where `Petal.Width` is less than 1.
