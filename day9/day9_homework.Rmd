1. Write a function to do a bunch of clean-up and formatting to your data.

2. Make sure this function works on your data.

3. Get some subset of your data, or find a similar-but-not-identical data set.  Change up the column order.  Re-run your function on this new data.  Does it work?

4. Fix your function to be able to work on the new data.

5. Write a function to do some kind of summary stat, and use the `dplyr` functions to run this function over groups of your data.
