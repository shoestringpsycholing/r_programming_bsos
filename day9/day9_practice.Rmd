1. Use the following data:

```{r}
miris <- iris
set.seed(42)
for(col in 1:4) {
  miris[sample(nrow(miris), 20, replace = FALSE), col] <- NA
}

```

2. Write a function that will:
  - take a vector of numbers as input
  - return the log of the largest non-NA value
  - Try this out on a vector that you make up
  
  
3. Run this function over rows of the data from #1

4. Write a function that will get the standard error of a vector of numbers. Use that function to get a standard error for each measure for each Species in the data from #1 (ignoring NAs)
