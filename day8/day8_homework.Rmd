1. Try to recreate the results of Homework 6 (or your intended results) using the `dplyr` functions.

2. Find another kind of analysis/transformation/summary stat that you want to apply across multiple groups in your data. Use the functions from `reshape2` and `dplyr` to get these results.

3. For one more practice, try another example of something like #2 (find another stat or grouping or something).
