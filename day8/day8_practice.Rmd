1. Start with this data:

```{r}
minpair <- read.csv("scottdata/CognitionPaperFinalData.csv")
```

2. Get the means of `WithinMinPairs` for each level of `Corpus`

3. Get cell means of `WithinMinPairs` by `Corpus` and `Merged`

4. Melt down the last four columns, which are all frequency measures.  Get the min, max, and mean log values for all of these measures, by Corpus and Merged.
  - HINT: melt down the frequency columns first
  
5. Do the same as 4, but only where HiSegTok is greater than the median value for each language.
